    "## Transactional Database\n",
    "A transactional database $D$ consists of $N$ transactions: $D=\\left\\{T_1,T_2,...,T_N\\right\\}$. A transaction $T_n \\in D (1 \\le n \\le N)$ contains one or more items and that $I= \\left\\{ i_1,i_2,…,i_M \\right\\}$ is the set of distinct items in $D$, $T_n \\subset I$. Commonly, a transactional database is represented by a flat file instead of a database system: items are non-negative integers, each row represents a transaction, items in a transaction separated by space.\n",

    "### Answer questions here:\n",
    "**Why don't we compute support of items while reading data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we calculate the support of items when reading the data, we won't know which items support needs to be calculated.Candidate sets will be generated when Apriori algorithm's running so we only need to calculate the support for those sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**why should we do sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "We sort support in ascending order of 's' so that when creating search_space and tree, the nodes of the tree will be generated in that order. Nodes with lower support, which lead to pruning, will be positioned at the front, allowing the algorithm to skip over all pruned nodes to start generating candidate sets from the non-pruned nodes located later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**study about python set and its advantages ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined by enclosing the elements in curly braces {}. The primary advantage of using a Python set includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: A set ensures that all elements inside it are unique. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it won't raise an error; instead, the duplicate element will simply be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Membership Testing: Checking for membership (i.e., whether an element is present in the set) is very efficient with sets. The average time complexity for membership testing in a set is O(1), making it much faster than lists (O(n)) for this operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Operations: Sets support various mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which can be very useful in many programming scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutability of Elements: While the set itself is mutable (i.e., you can add or remove elements), the elements inside a set must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples). This ensures that the elements can be hashed, which is necessary for efficient set operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient Removal and Addition: Adding and removing elements from a set is very efficient, with an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**After finish implementing the algorithm tell me why should you use this? Instead of delete item directly from search_space and tree.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't directly delete from search_space and tree, but rather mark them as pruned within the search_space, for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can know exactly where the search branch is cut off, avoiding loss of this information.\n",
    "- Deleting an element from a dictionary is a time-consuming operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apriori algorithm and Tree Projection, tell me the differences of two algorithms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the Apriori principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generates candidate itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires multiple scans of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses pruning strategies to reduce the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally consumes more memory.\n",

    "- Utilizes the FP-tree structure.\n",

    "- Constructs the FP-tree with a single scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grows frequent patterns by projecting the FP-tree.\n",
    "\n",
